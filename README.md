# NER Inference on linkedcat data from solr

This repo contains inferenced named entities and some context data, by having applied spaCy NER 
models on linkedcat SOLR data. There are two datasets on Solr: `linkedcat` (older) and `linkedcat2` 
(more recent and bigger). 

The inference veld chain, which produced this data repo can be found here:

The models were trained here:
